            <h3>Why I Fell in Love With <span class="tech">WEB TECHNOLOGY</span></h3>
            <p>In research on how people read websites, Nielsen Norman Group found that 79% of test users scanned the
                website, and only 16% of users read the text word by word.

                This means a website must have scannable text, including keywords, sub-headings, bulleted lists, only
                one idea in a paragraph, and fewer words to enable readers to run through the content.
                If a copy is not properly formatted for skimming and scanning, website visitors might lose their
                interest and skip to the next option in the search result. Good quality graphics, outbound hypertext
                links, and good writing together form a great copy.</p>
